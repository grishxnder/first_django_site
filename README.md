# My First Django WebSite

Hi uesrs! I am greeting you in README.md.
First of all, the Python-requirements:
Python3, Django version 3.2.4

This site was made with Django-technology, accordingly you sould open cmd. Move to package with project(with cd 'package/'), then execute 
```bash
python manage.py runserver'
```
Terminal was type the address of server.

There are 4 web-pages with different meaning. Main webpage - the simple greeting page, there are menu and jpg-file. 
Contact-webpage is the place, where you can recognize my contacts like e-mail, VKontakte or Telegram.
Load-upload webpage was created forisolate time-substance in your text.
History-load page was created for checking the answer, or disscover data-base of inputs.

Now, discuss how does it works?
At first post-request go to views.py, there are instructions for follow-up work. Further, calculated with supporting file practic.py response goes to forms.py, further - in web-page(html).
Html's pages was created with common-template, that is layout.html and Jinja-technology(for simple output model in tables).

It is my first documentation - do not judge strictly
